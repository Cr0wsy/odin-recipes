        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This butter-basted ribeye steak is an indulgent dish that is date night-worthy, perfect for company, and very easy to prepare. Use a high-quality herb butter for the best flavor.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (1 pound) rib eye steak</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons garlic and herb salted butter (such as KerrygoldÂ®), plus more for serving (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove steak from package, pat dry, and place on a plate. Refrigerate, uncovered, for 2 hours before cooking.</li>

            <li>Heat a heavy skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Sprinkle steak thoroughly with salt and pepper. Trim off any extra fat from steak. Place steak in skillet with fattest side down; cook until fat is browned, about 2 minutes. Continue cooking until steak is browned, about 2 minutes. </li>

            <li>Add butter to skillet and cook until butter is browned. Turn steak over and cook, basting with browned butter, for 2 minutes more. Remove from skillet to a plate. Tent with foil, and rest steak for 7 minutes to absorb juice. Serve steak with a pat of butter. </l>
        </ol>
